First, make sure to install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
In this updated code, we have added four new API endpoints. 

- The `/clients` endpoint with the `GET` method retrieves all clients.
- The `/clients/{client_id}` endpoint with the `GET` method retrieves specific client details by the provided `client_id`.
- The `/workflows` endpoint with the `GET` method retrieves all workflows.
- The `/workflows/{workflow_id}` endpoint with the `GET` method retrieves specific workflow details by the provided `workflow_id`.

The response for retrieving all clients and workflows will be a list of objects, while retrieving specific client and workflow details will return a single object.

You can make requests to these endpoints using cURL or tools like Postman to get the desired client and workflow information.
